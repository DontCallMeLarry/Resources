### Abstract 
>We attempt to analyse the economics around the Rune token in order to determine the potential behaviour of actors who will participate in the network on launch. Rune is bonded by validators that produce blocks for the network, as well as serving as the on-chain liquidity currency. Validators are paid in block rewards and transaction fees, whilst liquidity fees are paid to liquidity stakers. Validators also opt-in to become bridge nodes and earn on exit fees from bridges. The security of the network and the bridges are determined primarily by the value of Rune locked by the validators, but a tight coupling exists between the value of assets moved across to the network and the value of the Rune token. 

### Document Set
The following whitepapers should be read in conjunction:

- [THORChain](https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/tree/master/Whitepapers/THORChain) (this paper)
A lightning fast decentralised exchange protocol.

- [Bifr√∂st Protocol](https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/tree/master/Whitepapers/Bifrost-Protocol)
Secure and fast cross-chain bridges for THORChain.

## Overview

The function of the Rune token and its staking mechanisms are first described. Using real-world data from other staking coins, meaningful assumptions are then made about how the Rune token will be used in the network. Various scenarios are then explored in order to discover the potential equilibrium states that the network may converge to.
